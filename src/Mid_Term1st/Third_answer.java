    /* Question 3:
     * Scenario: Traffic ticketing system
     * Write a method, that will print (not return) the points charged against the license for over speeding.
     *    1. Speed Limit = 70
     *    2. Every 5 miles over the speed limit will add 1 point
     *    3. If user gets 12 points for a speed then license is suspended
     *
     *  Example:
     *      user speed = 78 ; 1 points
     *      user speed = 88 ; 3 points
     *      user speed = 178 ; 21 points (License suspended).
     *      user speed = 70 ; Thank you for driving within the speed limit.
     *
     *      88 -> 3
     *      70
     *      70-75 : 1
     *      75-80 : 1
     *      80-85 : 1
     *      85-88
